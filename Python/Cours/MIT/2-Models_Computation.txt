Algortihm with Al-Khwarizmi

What's an Algortihm ? 
-computational procedure for solving a problem
input -> alg -> output

program <-> Algortihm
Prog Language <-> Pseudo Code
Computer <-> model of computation               Model of computation 
                                            -what operation an algo is allowed
                                            -cost (time) of each up
--Random Acess Machine (RAM)
-Random Acess Memory modeled by big Array
in constant time can load words do O(1) computation
store O(1) words
O(1) registers

Word: w bits
log(size of memory)

--Pointer Machine:
dynamicanic allcoated objects
-objects has O(1) fields.
field = word()
